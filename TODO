DONE - Finish porting to C
    So that older architectures/compilers pre-dating C++ can generate the binary

Separate into compress/decompress library
    With a test main program
    Will allow for easy integration in other projects

Create switch for older architecture
    Probably a define at compile time
    For size optimization that will reduce memory requirements

Optimize for speed on older architectures
    Dependency: create switch for older architecture

Test on other platforms
    Currently supported: x86_64 Linux, m68k Atari ST
    Planned: m68k macintosh, m68k amiga, MIPS, SPARC
